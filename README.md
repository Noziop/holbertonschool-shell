# Shell

This repository contains the result of the 2nd week labor. Tasks that have been completed helps the student to understand a further more shell command (still using a sandbox), and pushing them to git.

# Content

 *  Basics : You'll find  basics scripts to help the student understand how scripts works, and to find the right command to implement into that script (accordingly to the task provided).
 *  Permissions : Scripts that deals with Users/Group/Other permissions.
 *  Shell, I/O Redirections and filters : Scripts that deals with slightly bit more advanced and usefull commands such as appending content to a file, using head/tail/grep and few more commands.
 *  init_files_variables_and_expansions : Same as basic, but with a bit more advanced shell command (introducing to variables, how do they work, how to print and/or change its value).
 *  Special treat : In almost each directory you'll find a script called "building_scripts". if you've navigate through the above listed dirs, you'll see that we had to create a lot of script and/or additional files.
                    So i decided to create a script that will bring some automation. at first, it was very simple, just prompting user for informations, and pushing the needed commands for almost all the assignements.
